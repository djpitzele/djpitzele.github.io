I am leading a project that aims to build a trace generation model with novel capabilities. Namely, the model will be able to generate trajectories for unseen tasks/environments with no additional fine-tuning (zero-shot). It will also generate fully functional robot actions from the previously mentioned trajectories. We are using a previous trace generation model from our lab as a baseline for our project.

This project is currently in progress, and thus I will not post any code/methods. However, please reach out if you would like to learn more.
