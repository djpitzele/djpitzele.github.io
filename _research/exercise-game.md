As a solo undergraduate under the guidance of a visiting researcher, I designed and implemented a lower body-focused exercise video game for seniors. I conducted a comprehensive [review of literature](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sjLzDGVgG-EZ3kxjTDKWDffW9HQXTcs5/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107390413415235575769&rtpof=true&sd=true){:target="_blank" :rel="noopener noreferrer"} on various fields involving the fitness of seniors and exercise video games as a whole. I then designed a computer vision-based exercise game to fit both fitness and hardware requirements (using only the laptop camera). Finally, I implemented the core gameplay mechanics using Unity and C#. The game utilized a pose-tracking model to allow the player's physical body to be used as the controlling mechanism.

This project is completed, but the code is not available as it has been used as part of a future work. However, I am happy to verbally discuss further project details. Although it was one of my first research experiences, I believe I learned a lot about the fundamentals of research from contributing to this project.
