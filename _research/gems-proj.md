I am a member of an undergraduate research team called Team COLOR. Our overarching goal is to contribute to a practical and accessible mitigation solution for color blindness. Our team is a part of the Gemstone honors program at UMD. In the program, undergraduates form teams and lead their research while being advised by mentors that are experts in their respective fields.

On this team, I am a major contributor to the programming subsection of our work. We created a physiologically-based simulation, roughly based on [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5290741){:target="_blank" :rel="noopener noreferrer"}, of how someone with color blindness sees the world. The simulation allows us to model various different versions (strengths) of anomalous trichromacy, specifically red-green color blindness. In the future, it could also be used to validate the efficacy of potential migitation solutions for these types of color blindness. [Our codebase](https://github.com/djpitzele/Team-COLOR-Sim){:target="_blank" :rel="noopener noreferrer"} is publicly available.

We also conducted an IRB-approved human study to validate our simulation. We captured data from over 30 participants on their ability to solve a color hue ordering test with and without the simulation. We aim to include the results, along with all the other work our team has done, in our honors thesis which will be completed by May 2026.
