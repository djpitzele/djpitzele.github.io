I am a senior undergraduate student at the University of Maryland studying computer science with a minor in philosophy. My academic interests lie in robotic perception. Specifically, I would like to investigate how robotic perceptual data can be leveraged to allow robots to more effectively navigate our physical world. I am active on multiple research projects, more information on which can be found on my [research page]({{ '/research/' | relative_url }}).

I plan to pursue a PhD at the intersection of computer vision and robotics. I am always happy to chat about my research (especially if you are considering my application). Feel free to send me an email.
