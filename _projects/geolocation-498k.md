As the course project for a Multimodal Deep Learning course, our group created a series of machine learning models to estimate how easy it would be for state-of-the-art VLMs to geolocate an image. We tackle this problem using multiple methods including end-to-end training and a binary classifier for using certain image features (architecture, vegetation, signage, etc). We also evaluated the potency of multiple anti-geolocation adversarial filters and algorithms. We produced a final report in the style of a research paper available <a href="{{ '/files/498k_geolocation_report.pdf' | relative_url }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
