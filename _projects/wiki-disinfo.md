I worked with a team of three other undergraduates to create a webapp that visualizes anti-disinformation projects for Wikipedia. Disinformation on Wikipedia is a major issue due to its open nature, and as a result many efforts have appeared to combat it. We created a website to visualize a directory of these projects. The website can be found [here](https://csdl.umd.edu/wikimap/){:target="_blank" :rel="noopener noreferrer"} \(if the project is still beng hosted\) and the code [here](https://github.com/CSDL-UMD/wiki-disinfo-map){:target="_blank" :rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
