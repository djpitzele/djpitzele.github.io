In a group of three undergraduates, we created a machine learning model to colorize black-and-white images. We utilized modern machine learning techniques including a U-Net architecture and combined multiple preassembled datasets to achieve plausible results on real-world images. This was done as a final project for a computer vision class (CMSC426). The code is available [here](https://github.com/rygelyance/Machine-Learning-Colorization-Engine){:target="_blank" :rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
